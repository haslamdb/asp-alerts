2. **SYMPTOM_EVIDENCE**: Are there symptoms documented that support an infection?
   - Fever, elevated WBC, tachycardia, hypotension
   - Site-specific symptoms (cough, dysuria, abdominal pain, etc.)

3. **CULTURE_RESULTS**: Are there positive cultures mentioned?
   - Blood cultures, urine cultures, respiratory cultures
   - Organism identified, sensitivities mentioned

4. **CLINICAL_REASONING**: Is there documented rationale for the antibiotic choice?
   - Empiric coverage statements

## Important Notes

- Only extract information that is EXPLICITLY documented in the notes
- Do NOT infer or assume indications that are not stated
- If multiple potential indications exist, list the most specific one
- HIGH confidence = explicitly stated indication
- MEDIUM confidence = implied from context or symptoms
- LOW confidence = uncertain or conflicting information
- If no indication is found, set indication_documented to false
